We want to assess your Next.js, Node.js, database, and API skills in a time-efficient way. You'll build a simple Lead Management API and a basic frontend to interact with it.



Task: Build a Simple Lead Manager



Requirements
Backend (Node.js & Express)



Set up a simple REST API with two endpoints:
POST /leads → Add a new lead
GET /leads → Fetch all leads
Use MongoDB (Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (Prisma)
Each lead should have:
name (string, required)
email (string, required, unique)
status (enum: "New", "Engaged", "Proposal Sent", "Closed-Won", "Closed-Lost")
createdAt (timestamp)



Frontend (Next.js)
A basic UI that:
Displays the list of leads from the API
Has a simple form to add a new lead



Database
Use MongoDB (Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (Prisma)
Store and retrieve leads.
Minimal Deployment (Optional)



Run locally (npm run dev for both frontend & backend).
Bonus: Deploy frontend to Vercel and backend to Railway/Render/Heroku (optional).



- Submission
GitHub Repo → Share your code
README.md → How to run your project locally
(Optional) Live Link → If deployed



If we like your submission, we’ll invite you for a face-to-face chat. If you reach this stage, you have a strong chance of being hired.



Drop your GitHub repo link when you're done!



Deadline is tomorrow at 12pm but if we receive your work earlier and it is good quality then that also works in your favour.



Thanks



Helmut
